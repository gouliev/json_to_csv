# JSON Toolkit

This repository hosts two essential tools for working with JSON files: a JSON to CSV Converter and a JSON Validator and Cleaner. These tools are designed to streamline the process of converting, validating, and cleaning JSON files before their conversion to CSV format.

## Tools

### 1. JSON to CSV Converter

Converts JSON files to CSV format, handling common exceptions and edge cases for a smooth conversion process.

### 2. JSON Validator and Cleaner

Validates the format of JSON files and cleans the data by removing unwanted or null fields, ensuring data consistency before conversion.

## Usage
### JSON to CSV Converter
Run the script and follow the interactive prompts to specify the JSON file you want to convert and the desired output CSV file path.

"python json_to_csv_converter.py"

### JSON Validator and Cleaner
Run the script, provide the path to your JSON file, and the tool will validate and clean the data, saving a new cleaned JSON file.

"python json_validator_and_cleaner.py"
